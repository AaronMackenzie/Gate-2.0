- **Lead** – Used in batteries and industrial applications.
- **Cobalt** – Key material in batteries and electronics, growing demand.
- **Lithium** – Used in electric vehicle batteries, though slightly more volatile.
- **Titanium** – Aerospace and medical industry demand.

# ➄ Livestock & Meat (More Stable Than Other Agricultural Commodities)
Animal-based commodities are less volatile than grains since demand remains consistent.
