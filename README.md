# Project Plan: Gate 2.0

## Objective
Gate 2.0 aims to develop a robust, automated trading strategy evaluation system. The project will involve collecting financial data, implementing and testing various trading strategies, automating backtesting, and incorporating risk management measures. The end goal is to optimize profitability while minimizing risk.

## Phases and Detailed Breakdown

### Phase 0: Initial Code Execution (Completed)
- Ran a basic script to fetch financial data and test a simple SMA-based strategy.
- Validated functionality by calculating profit percentage.

### Phase 1: Resource Analysis
- Identify required computational resources (CPU/GPU requirements, RAM, cloud vs. local execution).
- List essential Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TA-Lib, Backtrader, etc.).
- Consider API costs and limitations (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Binance API, etc.).
- Check regulations and compliance issues if planning real-world execution.
- Consider alternative data sources like macroeconomic indicators, commodity correlations, etc.
- Identify essential financial data sources:
  - Historical price data (OHLCV: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
  - Real-time market data (if needed).
  - Fundamental data (PE ratio, earnings reports, etc.).
  - Sentiment analysis data (news, social media trends).
  - Order book depth (if considering high-frequency trading).

### Phase 2: Data List
- Determine timeframes (1m, 5m, 1h, daily, weekly).
- Make a list of all the datasets that I plan to use.

### Phase 3: Data Acquisition
- Select APIs or direct data sources.
- Implement data fetching and storage solutions.
  - Local CSV files
- Set up automated data fetching scripts.
- Ensure data cleaning and preprocessing (handling NaNs, outliers).

### Phase 4: Algorithm List
- Create a list of trading strategies to implement:
  - Moving Average Crossovers (SMA, EMA).
  - Mean Reversion Strategies.
  - Momentum-based Strategies (RSI, MACD).
  - Volume-based Strategies (VWAP, OBV).
  - Market-making and Arbitrage.
  - Machine Learning-based Strategies (if applicable).
- Prioritize based on backtesting feasibility and complexity.

### Phase 5: Algorithm Library Preparation
- Implement selected strategies as modular, reusable functions.
- Standardize strategy inputs and outputs.
- Optimize for efficiency (vectorized operations, multiprocessing if needed).
- Store strategies in a structured format (class-based approach or function-based modules).

### Phase 6: Risk Management Strategy
- Define position sizing rules.
- Implement stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.
- Consider drawdown control methods.
- Apply portfolio allocation techniques (Kelly Criterion, Equal Weight, Risk Parity).
- Stress test strategies against extreme market conditions.

### Phase 7: Backtesting Design
- Develop a framework to test strategies with historical data.
- Ensure accurate transaction cost simulation (spread, slippage).
- Implement benchmark comparisons (e.g., compare against S&P 500).
- Visualize performance (cumulative returns, drawdowns, Sharpe ratio, etc.).
- Allow for parameter optimization and sensitivity testing.

### Phase 8: Backtesting Automation
- Automate strategy testing across multiple assets and timeframes.
- Parallelize computations for efficiency.
- Implement logging and result storage.
- Set up a dashboard to track backtesting results dynamically.

### Phase 9: Gate Designing (Core System Development)
- Integrate all components into a unified platform.
- Develop a strategy selection interface.
- Allow for real-time strategy testing (if required).
- Implement dynamic risk management adjustments.
- Scalability: Can the system handle multiple assets simultaneously?

### Phase 10: Test Run
- Validate end-to-end functionality.
- Run sample strategies in a controlled environment.
- Measure actual vs. expected performance.

### Phase 11: Launch
- Deploy the system for personal/professional use.
- Connect to live market feeds (if needed).
- Start executing selected strategies in real-time (paper trading or live trading).

### Phase 12: Monitoring and Maintenance
- Continuously track system performance.
- Adjust strategies based on market conditions.
- Optimize for speed and efficiency.
- Regulatory Compliance: Necessary if deploying in live trading.

### Phase 13: Celebrate ðŸŽ‰
- Evaluate achievements.
- Plan future improvements or new feature additions.
- Enjoy the success!

## Performance Metrics (Profit & Risk Management)

### Profitability Metrics
- **Total Return:** Overall percentage return of the strategy.
- **Annualized Return:** Standardized yearly profit.
- **Win Rate:** Percentage of profitable trades.
- **Profit Factor:** Ratio of total gains to total losses.

### Risk Metrics
- **Maximum Drawdown:** Largest peak-to-trough loss.
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Risk-adjusted return measurement.
- **Sortino Ratio:** Downside risk-adjusted return.
- **Volatility:** Standard deviation of returns.
